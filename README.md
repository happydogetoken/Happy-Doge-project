Happy Doge (HADO) is a hyper-deflationary token developed to reward investors for holding tokens. 
imply hold HADO tokens in your own wallet and watch more tokens accrue automatically. 
In addition to static rewards, Happy Doge incorporates a Buy Back feature to further deflate the circulating supply, thus increasing the value of each HADO token.
