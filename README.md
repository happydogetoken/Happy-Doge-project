Happy Doge (HADO) is a hyper-deflationary token developed to reward investors for holding tokens. Simply hold HADO tokens in your own wallet and watch more tokens accrue automatically. In addition to static rewards, Happy Doge incorporates a Buy Back feature to further deflate the circulating supply, thus increasing the value of each HADO token.

Several Cryptocurrencies have launched with popular
dog themes that proclaim massive community benefits.
A closer look at the tokenomics proves otherwise. They count on users not understanding and buying on impulse.

That’s why Happy Doge chose to offer safe tokenomics to protect beginners and veterans alike. Happy Doge simply uses RFI Static Rewards and a Buy Back mechanism to reward hodlers and increase value. At the same time, Happy Doge allows hodlers to maintain control of their funds in their own wallet, not on a centralized exchange, “not your keys, not your Happy Doge.”

Happy Doge collects a 6% buyback tax on each transaction that occurs on the network, and the collected amount is stored in a smart contract.

DeFi

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a trending term these days for good reason. DeFi offers the ability to bank, without a centralized entity. Not all DeFi is happy DeFi. Many have heard of rug-pulls, scams and supposedly DeFi opportunities in which users must hand over funds to the control of others.

Staking occurs when a user deposits their funds on a platform or interface, then earns rewards or yields based on the number of funds deposited. The investor often relinquishes control of their funds for a designated time period. So, what happened to the "Not your keys, not your crypto" motto? While staking provides nice rewards, these rewards are not always happy.

Investors need to place their trust in the platform and hope that it doesn't go defunct or simply disappear one day. Crypto-currencies offer lucrative opportunities but also volatility and the risk of manipulation. Investors not actively day-trading do not need to be checking their wallets on an hourly basis to ensure their funds are safe and earning.The cryptoverse is rife with scams, rug pulls, and tokens that moon than have very unhappy endings as they crash down to earth.
